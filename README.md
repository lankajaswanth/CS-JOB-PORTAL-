# CS Department Job Portal Prototype

This repository contains the prototype built for the Computer Science Department's Job Portal in our university, developed to streamline the student worker application process. The portal enables students to apply for teaching assistant (TA) and other student worker positions through a centralized system, reducing the need for direct email communication between students and professors.
